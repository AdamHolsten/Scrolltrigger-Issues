Publication Database
The NYU Wireless director’s number one priority for me was to “get our publications right.” For academics, listing and updating your center’s publication is key.

The previous NYU Wireless publication website was completely static. All of the publication information had to be updated seperately on evey page it was listed on. This type of infrastructure would be extremely frustrating to maintain. I had to create a system where faculty members and students could quickly enter and modify their publications in one location and these changes would update across the entire NYU Wireless digital landscape.

What I decided on was to use a customized wordpress post along with Post Table Pro to create a system of publications that can be searchable and sortable into a readable table. Not only could all the publications be accessed and edited in one location, each subject matter or publication author could have their specific publication table generated in a few lines of code.

Henry Rader & Son

I revitalized the branding and web experience for Jersey City's historical Henry Rader & Son Sheet Metal shop, established in 1906. Drawing inspiration from the shop's rich history and vintage photographs, including those dating back to the 1920s, I designed a website that captured the passion and craftsmanship resonating through decades of metalwork.

To guide the design process, I identified key brand principles: Custom, Gumption, Vintage, and Experienced. I explored diverse sources like 1950s American military and automobile ads, modern architecture, and upscale restaurant websites.

Crafting a logo with ornate script lettering exuding vintage charm, I incorporated the shop's tangible textures. Drawing on the dynamic nature of metalwork, I filmed shop workers in action, adding compelling video content to the website.

Notably, I featured a captivating video clip of a metalworker soldering a copper frame, showcasing the explosive energy of the craft. Although the site's format might seem somewhat dated by contemporary standards, I'm immensely pleased with the project's overall outcome. This endeavor marked a pivotal point in my web development journey, fostering an appreciation for video and motion's ability to captivate users and draw them into a website.




Jamie and Adam Wedding
Designing a wedding brand while planning it adds a unique layer of stress to an already demanding process. To craft the essence of our wedding, my partner and I embarked on a journey of visual discovery. We delved into various wedding websites and photos, extracting inspiration and crafting descriptors to encapsulate the desired ambiance: Fun, Relaxing, Family Friendly, Crafty, Homemade.

My objective was to infuse our personal touch into every aspect. My branding process commenced with creating a mood board from collected inspiration, honing in on fonts, colors, and photography styles that resonated with our chosen mood. Translating these elements, I designed a wedding logo, experimenting with sketching and adapting the font face for cohesion across our RSVP cards and print invitations.

Transitioning to the wedding website, I seized the opportunity to learn a new skill—basic SVG animation. Employing vivus, a lightweight JavaScript class, I animated SVGs, infusing dynamic stroke drawing without extensive coding. These animations offered an engaging visual journey, compatible with diverse browsers and mobile devices.

With collaborative efforts, my partner and I seamlessly coordinated everything for our momentous day. The unified aesthetic garnered appreciation from our guests, and beyond that, I acquired a spectrum of new skills throughout this fulfilling process.
